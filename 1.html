<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<a href="https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1168097&cid=40942&categoryId=32838" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
<p>HTML is a command that defines the font size, font color, graphic shape, and document movement (hyperlink) of a document and is used to create a website. The command used in HTML is called a tag, which is represented by the angle brackets "<>". In general, a tag consists of two pairs representing the beginning and the end, but in some cases, such as tags such as "img" and "br", the end tag begins with a slash character [/]. These HTML-written documents are called HTML documents, and the web browser interprets them and shows them to users. In HTML, a document can recognize a separate code to create a complete hypertext, as well as link words or paragraphs to other places or files on the Internet.</p>
<p><img src="bbh.jpg" width="100%">HTML was created to define the format of electronic documents and defined as a subset of the international standard SGML. HTML is a language created in SGML, particularly by highlighting hypertext, and is composed of plain text in ASCII codes. The language does not require a separate compiler and is recognized as an easy-to-use language that can be interpreted by web browsers.</p>
